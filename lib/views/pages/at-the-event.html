        <h3>Breaks, Food and Drinks</h3>
        <p>We will have several breaks between our talks. We will serve drinks before, during and after the event and due to a special deal with one of our sponsors (<a href="https://www.nexum.de/" target="_blank">Nexum</a>), we are able to serve you some fresh brewed local craft beer by <a href="http://www.bierlager.de/" target="_blank">Bierlager</a> for free during the event.</p>
        <p>Thanks to our sponsor <a href="http://www.michaelpage.de/" target="_blank">Michael Page</a>, we also have some food for you. It should be enough but please don’t take two or more servings at the beginning so everyone gets one.</p>
